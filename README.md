# Adaptive Sandwich Variance Package

- `After_Study_Analyses.py`: main code for after study analyses
- `RL_Study_Simulation.py`: main code for running RL algorithm experiements
- `basic_RL_algorithms.py`: includes code for boltzman sampling algorithm (called SigmoidLS)
- `debug_helper.py`: code I kept around from when I computed standard errors differently earlier. I keep it around to debug new code to make sure it matches.
- `helper_functions.py`: various helper functions
- `least_squares_helper.py`: functions to help with forming least squares estimators and estimating equations
- `oralytics_env.py`: oralytics environment (not cleaned up; haven't used in a while)
- `smooth_posterior_sampling.py`: code for smooth posterior sampling algorithm
- `synthetic_env.py`: synthetic simulation environment
- `run.sh`: script for running experiments
